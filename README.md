# Group12_FashionItemClassification
# 👗 Fashion Item Classification - Group 12

This project aims to build an image classifier using the **Fashion MNIST** dataset, which contains 70,000 grayscale images of 10 clothing categories such as shirts, trousers, and shoes. The goal is to train a deep learning model that can accurately classify these items and visualize its performance using a **confusion matrix**.

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📌 Key Features
- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Model building using a neural network (MLP or CNN)
- Evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix
- Visualization of class-wise predictions

## 📊 Output
The model achieves high accuracy and provides a confusion matrix to show where misclassifications occur, offering valuable insights for improvement.
